# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

I think that you use `.innerHTML` to create new html when are you copying and pasting HTML that is already create or if it is extremely complex. For example, if the HTML contains multiple parent and child elements with many attributes, using `.innerHMTL` can quickly be inserted. I think the best practice and better version is to use `.createElement` because it is much more flexible allowing the creator to freely interact with the element before appending to the HTML file. `.createElement` also allows iteration and resuability of code in order to format the HTML file.
